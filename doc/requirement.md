# Project Requirements

We need to use the core.logic library for Clojure. Of course, we are using Clojure and Lein, a package manager. The AI needs to be able to pass the Turing test, and needs the capability of implementing 'plugins' so that it can function alongside tools created for it (a calculator or something to tell the weather, for example). Right now, this requirement file is very vague; if someone could improve this, I would be very thankful.

We are using the core.logic library because the logic programming paradigm is very commonplace in artificial intelligence development. Lein helps us stay organized along with Github.
